## Color Draw
Free draw canvas with toolbar to select different color, line width, and eraser. Can also download image as a .png or upload image to the canvas and draw over it. 

Updates Needed:
- If window is adjusted the cursor is offcentered on canvas
- When image is uploaded to canvas the cursor is offcentered on canvas

## Download File Organizer
Takes files from the download folder and organizes it into sub folders based on file extension. Will create the subfolder if it does not exist. 

Create cron job or windows scheduler to run main.py script at a specific frequency.

## Recipe Finder
Use the jupyter notebook file (RecipeScrape) in order to find recipes from loveandlemons.com (using a page like "50 best vegetarian recipes" with a list of recipes to choose from). This saves the recipes in a csv.

Using the GUI from RecipeViewer.py you can view all the recipes in a table as well as filter based on recipe name, ingredients (use comma separated list in order to search for multiple ingredients), and cook time.

Future Additions:
- CSV with current ingredients in house, allow you to add and subtract ingredients from the GUI. Will use these to filter the recipes available
